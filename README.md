## Overview

"The Beluga's Magic Ocean Potion" is a children's story created by Elodie Harvey. This project transforms her handwritten story and illustrations into an interactive digital book that can be viewed in a web browser. The interactive book features:

- **Page-turning animations** that simulate a real book.
- **Responsive design** that adapts to various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
- **Accessibility features** for keyboard navigation and screen readers.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - The main HTML file containing the structure of the interactive book.
- Inline `<style>` tags in `index.html` - Contains all CSS styles for the book.
- Inline `<script>` tags in `index.html` - Contains all JavaScript logic for interactivity.
- `Images/` - A directory containing all the images used in the book (e.g., cover, page illustrations).
- `README.md` - This README file explaining the project and its creation process.

## Process Overview

The creation of the interactive storybook involved several key steps:

### 1. Image Generation

The images for the book were created using AI image generation tools.

- **Conceptualization**: Identified key scenes and elements from the story that needed illustrations.
- **AI Generation**: Used an AI image generator (e.g., OpenAI's DALLÂ·E) to create images based on descriptive prompts.
  - *Example Prompts*:
    - "A magical ocean scene with a beluga whale."
    - "A fish jumping out of the water."
- **Selection and Refinement**:
  - Generated multiple images per scene to choose the best fit.
  - Performed minimal editing if necessary (cropping, resizing) to ensure consistency.

### 2. Text Digitization

The handwritten text from Elodie's story was converted into digital format.

- **Scanning**: Scanned or photographed the handwritten pages to create clear images of the text.
- **AI Text Recognition**:
  - Used **Claude AI** to process the images and convert the handwritten text into digital text.
  - Ensured that the AI accurately captured the nuances of the handwriting.
- **Editing and Formatting**:
  - Reviewed the digitized text for any errors or misinterpretations.
  - Formatted the text for inclusion in the HTML structure.

### 3. Building the Interactive Book

The interactive book was built using standard web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

#### **HTML Structure**

- **Book Container**: A `<div>` with the class `book-container` serves as the main wrapper.
- **Pages**:
  - Each page is a `<div>` with the class `page`.
  - Pages are structured with front and back content (`.page-front`, `.page-back`).
- **Content**:
  - Text and images are placed within the appropriate page divs.
  - ARIA labels and roles are used to enhance accessibility.

#### **CSS Styling**

- **Reset and Base Styles**: Applied basic resets to remove default margins, padding, and set box-sizing.
- **Layout**:
  - Used flexbox to center the book on the page.
  - Set responsive dimensions using `vw` (viewport width) and `vh` (viewport height) units.
- **Page Styling**:
  - Styled pages to resemble real book pages with shadows and borders.
  - Implemented a spine for the book using CSS transformations.
- **Animations**:
  - Used CSS transitions and transforms for smooth page-turning animations.
  - Created media queries to adjust styles for different screen sizes.
- **Accessibility Styles**:
  - Included focus outlines and other visual cues for keyboard navigation.

#### **JavaScript Functionality**

- **Initialization**:
  - On document load, initialized the book by setting up page order and initial states.
- **Page Turning Logic**:
  - Managed the current page index and controlled the turning of pages forward and backward.
  - Added event listeners for click, touch, and keyboard events.
- **Event Handling**:
  - **Click Events**: Turned pages when users clicked on the turn areas.
  - **Touch Events**: Enabled swipe gestures for touch devices.
  - **Keyboard Events**: Allowed navigation using arrow keys, Page Up/Down, Home, and End keys.
- **Accessibility Features**:
  - Implemented ARIA live regions to announce page changes.
  - Ensured that interactive elements are focusable and have appropriate labels.

## How to Run the Project

To view and interact with the storybook:

1. **Download the Project**:
   - Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.

2. **Prepare the Images**:
   - Ensure that all image files are placed in the `Images/` directory.
   - Images should be named according to their references in `index.html` (e.g., `Cover.jpg`, `pageOne.jpg`, etc.).

3. **Open the HTML File**:
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

4. **Interact with the Book**:
   - Click on the right side of the book to turn pages forward.
   - Click on the left side to turn pages backward.
   - On touch devices, swipe left or right to navigate.
   - Use keyboard arrows for navigation:
     - Right Arrow or Page Down to go forward.
     - Left Arrow or Page Up to go backward.
     - Home to go to the beginning.
     - End to go to the last page.

## Customization

You can customize the storybook to create your own interactive stories.

- **Update Content**:
  - **Text**: Modify the story text within the HTML structure.
  - **Images**: Replace image sources with your own images. Ensure they are correctly referenced in the HTML.

- **Style Adjustments**:
  - Modify the `<style>` section in `index.html` to change fonts, colors, sizes, and layouts.
  - Adjust media queries to fine-tune responsiveness for different devices.

- **Functional Changes**:
  - Update the JavaScript logic in the `<script>` section to alter interactivity.
  - Add new features such as audio narration, background music, or interactive elements within pages.

## Accessibility Considerations

This project includes several features to enhance accessibility:

- **Semantic HTML**: Used appropriate HTML elements and attributes for better screen reader support.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Users can navigate the book using standard keyboard keys.
- **Focus Management**: Interactive elements are focusable and have appropriate labels.
- **ARIA Labels**: Added ARIA attributes to provide additional context to assistive technologies.
- **Live Regions**: Implemented ARIA live regions to announce page changes.
